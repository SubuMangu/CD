**Translator**
---
- Translator  is  a  program  that  converts  the  source  code  written  in  high  level 
programming language to target code or object code. 
- Object code is nothing but the 
code that written in machine understandable language or low level language that a 
computer can understand

**Analysis phase**
- Known as the front-end of the compiler
- the analysis phase of the compiler reads the source program, divides it into core parts and then checks for lexical, grammar and syntax errors.The analysis phase generates an intermediate representation of the source program and symbol table, which should be fed to the Synthesis phase as input.

**Synthesis phase**
- Known as the back-end of the compiler, the synthesis phase generates the target program with the help of intermediate source code representation and symbol table.

**Steps to execute a program**

- **Relocatable Machine Code:** Relocatable machine code is machine language that can be run from any memory location and whose execution address can be changed. 
- **Absolute machine code** is a type of computer code that loads at a specific, fixed memory address.It's generated when the compiler knows where the process will reside in memory.
- **Target Assembly Code**:Target assembly code is the low-level, human-readable code that is generated by a compiler or assembler for a specific processor architecture or target machine.
- A **linker** is a computer program that takes multiple object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file by resolving references between different code sections, essentially "linking" all the parts of a program together to create a functional application; it allocates memory and ensures all parts of the program connect correctly.

## LEX(Lexical analyzer generator)
- A **lexical analyzer generator** is a tool that automatically creates a lexical analyzer (lexer) from a given set of rules or regular expressions, typically for use in compilers.
- LEX is an example of Lexical Analyzer Generator.

**Input to LEX**
- The input to LEX consists primarily of Auxiliary Definitions and Translation Rules
- **Auxiliary Definitions:** Shortcuts or names you create for commonly used patterns to make them easier to write and understand.
- **Translation Rules:** Instructions that say what to do when the lexer finds certain patterns, like printing a message or taking an action.
- Translation Rules comprise of a ordered list Regular Expressions and the Program Code to be
executed in case of that Regular Expression encountered.

**Implementation of LEX**
- The Regular Expressions are converted into NFA’s. The final states of each NFA correspond to
some RE and its Program Code.
- Different NFA’s are then converted to a single NFA with epsilon moves.The final states have an order according to the corresponding RE’s. 
- This NFA is then converted to DFA

## Symobol Table

**Operations on a Symbol Table**
- Determine whether a given name is in the table
- Add a new name to the table
- Access information associated to a given name
- Add new information for a given name
- Delete a name (or a group of names) from the table
