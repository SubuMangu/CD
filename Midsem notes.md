**Translator**
---
- Translator  is  a  program  that  converts  the  source  code  written  in  high  level 
programming language to target code or object code. 
- Object code is nothing but the 
code that written in machine understandable language or low level language that a 
computer can understand

**Analysis phase**
- Known as the front-end of the compiler
- the analysis phase of the compiler reads the source program, divides it into core parts and then checks for lexical, grammar and syntax errors.The analysis phase generates an intermediate representation of the source program and symbol table, which should be fed to the Synthesis phase as input.

**Synthesis phase**
- Known as the back-end of the compiler, the synthesis phase generates the target program with the help of intermediate source code representation and symbol table.

- **Relocatable Machine Code:** Relocatable machine code is machine language that can be run from any memory location and whose execution address can be changed. 
- **Absolute machine code** is a type of computer code that loads at a specific, fixed memory address.It's generated when the compiler knows where the process will reside in memory.
- **Target Assembly Code**:Target assembly code is the low-level, human-readable code that is generated by a compiler or assembler for a specific processor architecture or target machine.
